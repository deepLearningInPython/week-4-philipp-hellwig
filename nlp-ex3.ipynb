This is mainly because each recurrent layer needs to iteratively process one word embedding after the other, in sequence. This fundamentally prevents paralellization of the computations on multiple processor cores or on GPUs and/or TPUs. Instead of RNN layers, GPT2 uses a mechanism called \"_self attention_\" which does allow for parallelization. \"Self attention\" is similar but not identical to the gating process that takes place in LSTMs and GRUs: The sequence of input embeddings is turned into a new sequence of embeddings in the form of weighted averages of the input embeddings. The idea is that each weighted average will represent a different semantic unit in the input sequence. The weights for computing these averages are computed from the input embeddings using a feed forward layer that is simultaneously trained with the entire network. The output from this is called an \"_attention head_\", and often multiple such attention heads are run in parallel, in which case the outputs are concatenated. If the (concatenated) sequence of attention head outputs is then passed through a feed forward layer, we speak of a (self-attending) \"_transformer_\" block. GPT2 (as well as BERT) stacks multiple such transformer blocks on top of each other; hence the term Transformer in its name. \n\n<details><summary>Self-attention and transformer in some detail</summary>\nLet $u_j, j=0, \\ldots, n-1$ is the sequence of word embeddings, and let $U = [u_0, u_2, \\ldots, u_{n-1}]$.

For example, the second row encodes the probability $P(T\\, |\\, \\mathtt{Machine, learning})$ where $T$ is any token in the vocabulary, and hence, it can be used to compute the probability $P(\\mathtt{will}\\,|\\, \\mathtt{Machine, learning})$ for instance, or the probability $P(\\mathtt{has}\\, |\\, \\mathtt{Machine, learning})$. The token $T$ for which this _conditional_ probability is the highest, is the most likely token to follow the sequence `[Machine, learning]`.\n\nThe last row in the matrix specifies the _conditional_ probability for the next token _given_ the entire sequence so far: \n\n$$P(T\\,|\\,\\mathtt{Machine, learning, with, T, ensor, Flow, can, do, amazing}),$$\n\nwhere $T$ is a token in the vocabulary. (If you wonder about the split between `T`, `ensor`, and `Flow`, look back at the encoding above.)\n\nSo why does `logits` not just give the last row of this matrix, but all the intermediate probabilities $P(T|\\mathtt{Machine}), P(T|\\mathtt{Machine, learning}), P(T|\\mathtt{Machine, learning, with})$, etc. as well? \n\nThe answer lies in the fact that GPT2 is a _generative language model_, meaning that it wants to give the _joint_ probability $P(\\mathtt{Machine, learning, with, T, ensor, Flow, can, do, amazing})$ and not (just) the conditional probability from the last row: The matrix of logits encodes the entire probability of observing the sequence of tokens. Recall from probability theory that \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n    P(&\\mathtt{Machine,learning,with,\\ldots,amazing}) \\\\\n    &= P(\\mathtt{Machine})\\cdot P(\\mathtt{learning,with,\\ldots,do,amazing}|\\mathtt{Machine})\\, \\\\\n    &= P(\\mathtt{Machine})\\cdot P(\\mathtt{learning}|\\mathtt{Machine})\\cdot P(\\mathtt{with,\\ldots,do,amazing}|\\mathtt{Machine, learning}) \\\\\n    &= P(\\mathtt{Machine})\\cdot P(\\mathtt{learning}|\\mathtt{Machine})\\cdot P(\\mathtt{with}|\\mathtt{Machine,learning})\n    \\cdots P(\\mathtt{amazing}|\\mathtt{Machine,learning,with,\\ldots,do})\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nNotice that all of the conditional probabilities on the right hand side of the last line are represented by the rows of the `logits` attribute.\n\n#### The token predicted to follow 'amazing'\n\n\n    \nLet's try to find the token $T$ in the vocabulary that is the most likely to follow the text \"_Machine learning with TensorFlow can do amazing_\" according to GPT2. To a human this sentence screams that the word 'things' should follow, but does GPT2 also think so too?\n\n\n    \nTo do so, we can take the last row from `output.logits`, compute the conditional probabilties and find the token for which this is largest.
